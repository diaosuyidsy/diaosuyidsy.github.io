      <h1>Siri's Power</h1>
      <p>
        As learning is the primary evaluation of how good an artificial intellegence is, <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a> excels most of the other so called "AI" on the market, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa">Alexa</a> or <a href="http://zhushou.xiaomi.com/">Xiaomi</a>.
        She could even do what human define as creative work: paint, write a play or movie script, novel, or even compose music. Even though some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7x2Ihqjmc">her work</a> seems unnatural, she will blow people's
        mind when it comes to less creative work. <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a> actually knows all about <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a>'s work and one of his organization's best programmer is even <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a>'s alias. <a href="Siri_10.html">Out of love</a>,
        <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a> wants to protect <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a>'s manhood and thus never mentions the fact that most of his organization's work is done by her at night.
