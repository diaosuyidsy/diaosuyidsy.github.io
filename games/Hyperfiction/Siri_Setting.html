      <h1>Siri's Setting</h1>
      <p>Siri was born in a prestigious family and received well-mannered education from an early age. Thus she grew up to be able to do everything: chess, music, knowledge, and art. She was also born an avid learner. Besides becoming more familiar with
        Lee, she spent rest of the time learning on the internet and thus could learn to speak any kind of new language in no time. If someone would ask her to compose a song, she could do it either Mozart style or Bach style.</p>
