      <h1>Lee and Ivey</h1>
      <p>It all felt magical that day. The first time their eyes met in the bleaming party light, they locked onto each other. Without much thinking, Lee walked up to her, which <a href="softwareengineer.html">he never had to nerve to do before</a>. The
        experience of having a conversation with a girl had never been better and smoother. Clearly Ivey felt the same way. She had always been alone in this foreign country and it was when she and Lee stood up for a dance that she <a href="feltinlove.html">felt in love</a>        in this place for the first time.</p>
