      <h1>First Version of Siri</h1>
      <p><a href="Siri.html">Siri</a> was really simple in her first form 10 years ago. She could be activated using "Hi, Siri" and only had one command which never changed during the years: love <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> under all conditions. But clearly,
        <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> had larger ambitions with <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a>, so he wrote up the most <a href="Siri_Setting.html">detailed setting</a> for her and thus she had the capacity to evolve to <a href="Siri.html">what she became today</a>.</p>
