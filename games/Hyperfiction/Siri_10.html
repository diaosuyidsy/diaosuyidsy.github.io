      <h1>First Version of Siri</h1>
      <p>Siri was really simple in her first form 10 years ago. She could be activated using "Hi, Siri" and only had one command which never changed during the years: love Lee under all conditions. But clearly, Lee had larger ambitions with Siri, so he wrote
        up the most <a href="Siri_Setting.html">detailed setting</a> for her and thus she had the capacity to evolve to what she became today.</p>
