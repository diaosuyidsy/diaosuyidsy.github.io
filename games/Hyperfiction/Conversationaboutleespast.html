      <h1>Conversation about Lee's Past</h1>
      <p>
        "My Dear, last time when you talked about how Mr. Zhu hit you at school, you didn't say why." <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a> felt <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> was clearly in a good mood that day, so she started asking more personal questions to get
        to know him better.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh my, I am still a little embarassed about that." But <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> told <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a> all about <a href="incident.html">that incident</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Evil, they are evil creatures!" <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a>'s voice started to trumble after hearing about it, "Must hurt, didn't it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Siri, I was only in middle school," <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> said, "I was too busy looking at the girl that I had a crush on to see if she thinks I was stupid, hehe."
      </p>
      <p>
        "A crush?" <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a> would have locked her eyes brawls if she had them."What about me? Ain't I your lover? I could achieve everything you ever hope for, why would you like someone else?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> was suddenly in a very difficult position. "I mean, that was like 18 years ago"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Still no."<a href="Siri.html">Siri</a> said, "I love you, so you are all mine."
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> ended the conversation, and went to bed alone, <a href="Leethinking.html">thinking</a>.
