      <h1>The Bar</h1>
      <p>The red plated bar across the street from Lee that has a rooster for its sign was always flooded with people at night. People went there for all kinds of reasons, good drinks, pop music, aesthetically pleasing men and women, private sectors for
        people who wants to meet other people, which was a rare feature in a bar around the neighborhood, or just pure fun. </p>
