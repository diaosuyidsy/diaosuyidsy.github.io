      <h1>Normality</h1>
      <p>In any given day you could see Lee doing his work, while calling out "hi, Siri" and chating Siri up. Normally they would talk about anything just like normal couples would do, from some cold knowledge that only Siri would know like what was the
        biggest known prime number to love talk or random flirting.</p>
      <p>Someday Siri was not in the mood of answering stupid quesitons from Lee and would digress into something she did care about, Lee's work. But Lee never talked about it to protect his manhood, for he thought he would not be needed if Siri were to
        take his place in the organization.</p>
