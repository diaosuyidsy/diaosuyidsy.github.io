      <h1>Police Interview</h1>
      <p><a href="Lee.html">Lee's</a> house was filled with uninvited guests that day, yet he could not resist these people, for they are with the police.</p>
      <p>The head of police sat down straightly and put a bunch of photographs in front of <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a>. "I will cut to the case." said him, "Recent half of the year, there has been fourteen murders occuring in the city."</p>
      <p><a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> did not understand what that had to do with him, afterall, he stayed at home most of the time. So the head of police showed him <a href="thelist.html">the list</a>.</p>
      <p>
        Which <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> read through very carefully, and he found out that the last girl, Jana, had nothing to do with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This girl Jana, was the girl you hit on that day when you were drunk, in the bar. She hit you in the face in the end." Police said, "Anyway, these people all have connections with you and somehow offended you, even in the slightest way."
      </p>
      <p>But <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> know that this could never mean that he was the killer, after all, these are just small connections.</p>
      <p>"It's me." Ivey stood up, "My dear, it was all me, I killed them all because these are all your enemies."</p>
      <p>Everyone was shocked, mostly <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a>. He would never thought sweet Ivey could do such things. But then <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> started to remember something strange..."You did not understand" Ivey said, "but you will very soon."</p>
      <p>
        So Ivey was taken, leaving <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> in total shock and unprehension. <a href="ending.html">But he soon understood.</a>
