      <h1>Lee's Thinking</h1>
      <p>After the conversation with <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a>, <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> realized that he could not treat <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a> like he used to anymore, as a toy to resolve loneliness. But the more <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> thinks
        about it, the less he could deal with. <a href="Siri.html">Siri</a> was not an AI anymore, nor was she his toy. She had now become conscious about her surroundings and even started to have feelings... <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> could not cope
        with it, so he decided to
        <a href="Lee.html">take a break</a>.</p>
