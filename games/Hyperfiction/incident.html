      <h1>The Incident</h1>
      <p>
        Back in the day when Lee was still in middle school, hitting a student on his/her palm was considered discipline instead of physical assult. Ian Zhao, one of Lee's Classmates, was messing with Mr. Zhu's chemical equipment and he mixed some of the compound
        together, rendering them useless. Mr. Zhu was furious when he found it out. Afraid that he would be punished, Zhao ratted Lee out, despite that he had nothing to do with it. Mr. Zhu did not listen to Lee's argument and punished him severely.
