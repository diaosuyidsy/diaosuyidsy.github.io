      <p>Internet safety consultants, as <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a> put it, were the "savior behind the curtain" of the digital world and his current job title. The organization only contained a handful of people all around the world who has never met in
        real life, and yet, 87.54% of the websites currently up on the internet would collapse without their help.</p>
